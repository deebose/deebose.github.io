Hi there, this is Deepasmita Bose.  This sight is a blog in which I talk about how I went throught the process of self discovery, which by far, is not a trivial process.  Instead of redirecting you to an about me page, I though I will introduce my self a little here.

I am from the Kolkata and am presently located in the United State.  By profession, I work as a Business Analyst.  By hobby, I love to live my life, try out new recipies and make stories - all of which I hope to tell you (to an extent).  With this website, I discovered that I can also learn how to script in markdown and set up a website using github.  Yay!
